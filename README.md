Blippy
======

Blippy project created for Proffesor Rick Neff in CS 246 'Software Design and Developement'

Blippy was designed for Mister Call at Madison Highschool in Rexburg, ID for his advanced placement anatomy and
physiology course to test each student's reaction time.

Blippy supports a number of different options including a colorblind test, a sound test, and various game options
such as pause reset, etc. After the test it displays the results of the test to the user. They may then retake the
test, or exit the program.

Blippy was my first project using javaFX.
